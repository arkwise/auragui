Changelog for the DJGPP Port of GNU Fileutils 4.1, release 7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bugs fixed in Release 7 - 2003-08-30
------------------------------------

* Work-around for problems with the inode check in rm and Windows 2000
  and XP. Disable the inode check for now.

* Update my e-mail address in the sources.

* Update readme.dos with details of newer packages.

* Don't include the automake 1.5 diff anymore. Assume that the user
  has automake 1.5 release 2 or a later version of automake.

* Don't include my porting notes anymore. They're not relevant.

Bugs fixed in Release 6 - 2003-03-27
------------------------------------

* 'ln -s' supports generating a stub, when symlinking to a program.
  Previously 'ln -s' may have generated a stub, when the source was not
  a program.

  E.g.:

    touch foo
    ln -s foo bar

  previously created a stub 'bar.exe'. This was incorrect, because
  foo was not a program.

  This bug was due to a bug in DJGPP 2.03's libc. A fixed version
  of the source file, symlink.c, is included in the source distribution.

Bugs fixed in Release 5 - 2003-01-13
------------------------------------

* djgpp/readme.dos: Add a note about the problems people are having
  when trying to use scroll back to view ls's colourised output
  under Windows 2000 and XP.

* src/djstart.c: When building against DJGPP CVS (what will become
  DJGPP 2.04), enable /dev/zero and /dev/full.

* src/ls.c: Fix a bug in the handling of symlinks with drive-qualified
  absolute or relative DOS paths, when 'ls' was built with DJGPP CVS
  (what will become DJGPP 2.04).

  NB: This bug did not affect Fileutils 4.1 distributed
  via the DJGPP archive on Simtel.NET.

* src/remove.c: Fix a bug that occasionally caused 'rm' to crash.

Bugs fixed in Release 4 - 2002-12-04
------------------------------------

* lib/dirname.c: The variable 'append_dot' was not properly uninitialised,
  which could cause programs such as mkdir to segfault (a crash),
  presumably due to memory corruption. This has been fixed.

* src/remove.c: When fileutils 4.1 release 3 was built with DJGPP CVS,
  'rm' would segfault (a crash), due to a failed assertion. This has
  been fixed.

  NB: This bug did not affect Fileutils 4.1 distributed
  via the DJGPP archive on Simtel.NET.

Bugs fixed in Release 3 - 2002-10-11
------------------------------------

* djgpp/readme.dos: Volume labels are only displayed when both '-a'
  and '-g' are displayed. Fixed the description of '-g'.

* src/ls.c: Always set the stat and opendir bits. This fixes the bug
  where 'ls' run with no arguments showed hidden files.

* src/ls-msdos.c: When setting the default stat and opendir bits, clear
  __OPENDIR_FIND_HIDDEN as well as setting __OPENDIR_NO_HIDDEN.

Bugs fixed in Release 2 - 2002-09-15
------------------------------------

* src/ln.c: Pretend that we support symlinks, so that 'ln -s' works
  as it did in previous versions of the port. 'ln -s' will create
  an executable stub which runs the target of the symlink. This kind
  of symlink is fine for links to executables, but otherwise useless.

Bugs fixed in Release 1 - 2002-06-11
------------------------------------

* src/djstart.c: Strip off the path from the program name.
  This behaviour is more Unixy and should allow much of the test suite
  to pass without hacking the test scripts to cope with full paths.

* src/djutils.c: <sys/types.h> needed to be included for the case
  where HAVE_LSTAT was defined, but HAVE_FCHOWN was not.

* Include a 'changelog' directive in the DSMs.

* A bug was found in the DJGPP port of automake 1.5, which meant
  that the install sections in doc/Makefile were running commands
  that failed, because of syntax errors (the "CDPATH" bug).
  A patch for automake is now included in the port.

* lib/getdate.y: Add missing semi-colons in rules. These errors were
  caught by Bison 1.35.

* tests/dd/Makefile: This should now try to run skpseek2 rather than
  (the incorrectly named) skp-seek2. The Makefile had not been
  properly generated in the previous version.

* tests/cp/backup-is-src, tests/cp/into-self, tests/cp/same-file,
  tests/mv/backup-is-src, tests/mv/diag, tests/mv/force,
  tests/mv/i-2, tests/mv/to-self, tests/mv/to-self3: Revert changes
  to test scripts, where we strip off the path from the program name
  in messages. The program name is now stripped off by
  the Fileutils-special start-up code in djstart.c.

* djgpp/config.bat, djgpp/mkconfig.sh: Make it work properly in
  short-filename (SFN) environments. Try to make it work properly in
  mixed environments like Windows NT 4 without an long-filename (LFN) TSR,
  where the shell supports LFNs, but DJGPP programs don't.

* tests/cp/same-file, tests/mv/part-symlink: Redirect to the file _err
  rather than .err, since .err is not a valid short filename.

* tests/mv/to-self, tests/mv/force, tests/touch/no-rights: Reduce
  the length of the test filenames, so they fight uniquely into the SFNs.
