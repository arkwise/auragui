Once upon a time, a long, LONG time ago, DJ asked for a version of
SYMIFY that would be based on BFD functions, rather than on our
private syms.c from libdbg.a.  The advantage of this would be that
such a program would automatically support every format of debugging
info that BFD is configured to support, not only the COFF debug info
supported by libdbg.a.

Well, it took more than a year, but I finally got to making it happen.
I called the program BFDSYMIFY, but that's a temporary name (it also
exceeds DOS 8+3 limits, which isn't very nice), so if you have a
better name, I am open to suggestions.  My intent was to eventually ask
the Binutils maintainer to include this program as part of Binutils,
but it looks like it won't happen any time soon...

In the meantime, I'm making it available as part of GDB distro.

Please tell me how well does bfdsymify work (or doesn't work) for you.


Enjoy,
