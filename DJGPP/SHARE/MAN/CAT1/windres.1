       wwiinnddrreess reads resources from an input file and copies them into an
       output file.  Either file may be in one of three formats:

       "rc"
           A text format read by the Resource Compiler.

       "res"
           A binary format generated by the Resource Compiler.

       "coff"
           A COFF object or executable.

       The exact description of these different formats is available in
       documentation from Microsoft.

       When wwiinnddrreess converts from the "rc" format to the "res" format, it is
       acting like the Windows Resource Compiler.  When wwiinnddrreess converts from
       the "res" format to the "coff" format, it is acting like the Windows
       "CVTRES" program.

       When wwiinnddrreess generates an "rc" file, the output is similar but not
       identical to the format expected for the input.  When an input "rc"
       file refers to an external filename, an output "rc" file will instead
       include the file contents.

       If the input or output format is not specified, wwiinnddrreess will guess
       based on the file name, or, for the input file, the file contents.  A
       file with an extension of _._r_c will be treated as an "rc" file, a file
       with an extension of _._r_e_s will be treated as a "res" file, and a file
       with an extension of _._o or _._e_x_e will be treated as a "coff" file.

       If no output file is specified, wwiinnddrreess will print the resources in
       "rc" format to standard output.

       The normal use is for you to write an "rc" file, use wwiinnddrreess to convert
       it to a COFF object file, and then link the COFF file into your
       application.  This will make the resources described in the "rc" file
       available to Windows.

       ----iinnppuutt _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
           The name of the input file.  If this option is not used, then
           wwiinnddrreess will use the first non-option argument as the input file
           name.  If there are no non-option arguments, then wwiinnddrreess will read
           from standard input.  wwiinnddrreess can not read a COFF file from
           standard input.

       ----oouuttppuutt _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
           The name of the output file.  If this option is not used, then
           wwiinnddrreess will use the first non-option argument, after any used for
           the input file name, as the output file name.  If there is no non-
           option argument, then wwiinnddrreess will write to standard output.
           wwiinnddrreess can not write a COFF file to standard output.  Note, for
           compatibility with rrcc the option --ffoo is also accepted, but its use
           is not recommended.

       ----iinnppuutt--ffoorrmmaatt _f_o_r_m_a_t
           The input format to read.  _f_o_r_m_a_t may be rreess, rrcc, or ccooffff.  If no
           input format is specified, wwiinnddrreess will guess, as described above.

       --OO _f_o_r_m_a_t
       ----oouuttppuutt--ffoorrmmaatt _f_o_r_m_a_t
           The output format to generate.  _f_o_r_m_a_t may be rreess, rrcc, or ccooffff.  If
           no output format is specified, wwiinnddrreess will guess, as described
           above.

       --FF _t_a_r_g_e_t
       ----ttaarrggeett _t_a_r_g_e_t
           Specify the BFD format to use for a COFF file as input or output.
           This is a BFD target name; you can use the ----hheellpp option to see a
           list of supported targets.  Normally wwiinnddrreess will use the default
           format, which is the first one listed by the ----hheellpp option.

       ----pprreepprroocceessssoorr _p_r_o_g_r_a_m
           When wwiinnddrreess reads an "rc" file, it runs it through the C
           preprocessor first.  This option may be used to specify the
           preprocessor to use, including any leading arguments.  The default
           preprocessor argument is "gcc -E -xc-header -DRC_INVOKED".

       ----pprreepprroocceessssoorr--aarrgg _o_p_t_i_o_n
           When wwiinnddrreess reads an "rc" file, it runs it through the C
           preprocessor first.  This option may be used to specify additional
           text to be passed to preprocessor on its command line.  This option
           can be used multiple times to add multiple options to the
           preprocessor command line.

       --II _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
       ----iinncclluuddee--ddiirr _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
           Specify an include directory to use when reading an "rc" file.
           wwiinnddrreess will pass this to the preprocessor as an --II option.
           wwiinnddrreess will also search this directory when looking for files
           named in the "rc" file.  If the argument passed to this command
           matches any of the supported _f_o_r_m_a_t_s (as described in the --JJ
           option), it will issue a deprecation warning, and behave just like
           the --JJ option.  New programs should not use this behaviour.  If a
           directory happens to match a _f_o_r_m_a_t, simple prefix it with ..// to
           disable the backward compatibility.

       --DD _t_a_r_g_e_t
       ----ddeeffiinnee _s_y_m[[==_v_a_l]]
           Specify a --DD option to pass to the preprocessor when reading an
           "rc" file.

       --UU _t_a_r_g_e_t
       ----uunnddeeffiinnee _s_y_m
           Specify a --UU option to pass to the preprocessor when reading an
           "rc" file.

       --rr  Ignored for compatibility with rc.

       --vv  Enable verbose mode.  This tells you what the preprocessor is if
           you didn't specify one.

       --cc _v_a_l
       ----ccooddeeppaaggee _v_a_l
           Specify the default codepage to use when reading an "rc" file.  _v_a_l
           should be a hexadecimal prefixed by 00xx or decimal codepage code.
           The valid range is from zero up to 0xffff, but the validity of the
           codepage is host and configuration dependent.

       --ll _v_a_l
       ----llaanngguuaaggee _v_a_l
           Specify the default language to use when reading an "rc" file.  _v_a_l
           should be a hexadecimal language code.  The low eight bits are the
           language, and the high eight bits are the sublanguage.

       ----uussee--tteemmpp--ffiillee
           Use a temporary file to instead of using popen to read the output
           of the preprocessor. Use this option if the popen implementation is
           buggy on the host (eg., certain non-English language versions of
           Windows 95 and Windows 98 are known to have buggy popen where the
           output will instead go the console).

       ----nnoo--uussee--tteemmpp--ffiillee
           Use popen, not a temporary file, to read the output of the
           preprocessor.  This is the default behaviour.

       --hh
       ----hheellpp
           Prints a usage summary.

       --VV
       ----vveerrssiioonn
           Prints the version number for wwiinnddrreess.

       ----yyyyddeebbuugg
           If wwiinnddrreess is compiled with "YYDEBUG" defined as 1, this will turn
           on parser debugging.

       @@_f_i_l_e
           Read command-line options from _f_i_l_e.  The options read are inserted
           in place of the original @_f_i_l_e option.  If _f_i_l_e does not exist, or
           cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
           removed.

           Options in _f_i_l_e are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
           character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
           option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including
           a backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be
           included with a backslash.  The _f_i_l_e may itself contain additional
           @_f_i_l_e options; any such options will be processed recursively.
