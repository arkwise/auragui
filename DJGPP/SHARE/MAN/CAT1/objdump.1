DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       oobbjjdduummpp displays information about one or more object files.  The
       options control what particular information to display.  This
       information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the
       compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their
       program to compile and work.

       _o_b_j_f_i_l_e... are the object files to be examined.  When you specify
       archives, oobbjjdduummpp shows information on each of the member object files.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
       equivalent.  At least one option from the list
       --aa,,--dd,,--DD,,--ee,,--ff,,--gg,,--GG,,--hh,,--HH,,--pp,,--PP,,--rr,,--RR,,--ss,,--SS,,--tt,,--TT,,--VV,,--xx must be given.

       --aa
       ----aarrcchhiivvee--hheeaaddeerr
           If any of the _o_b_j_f_i_l_e files are archives, display the archive
           header information (in a format similar to llss --ll).  Besides the
           information you could list with aarr ttvv, oobbjjdduummpp --aa shows the object
           file format of each archive member.

       ----aaddjjuusstt--vvmmaa==_o_f_f_s_e_t
           When dumping information, first add _o_f_f_s_e_t to all the section
           addresses.  This is useful if the section addresses do not
           correspond to the symbol table, which can happen when putting
           sections at particular addresses when using a format which can not
           represent section addresses, such as a.out.

       --bb _b_f_d_n_a_m_e
       ----ttaarrggeett==_b_f_d_n_a_m_e
           Specify that the object-code format for the object files is
           _b_f_d_n_a_m_e.  This option may not be necessary; _o_b_j_d_u_m_p can
           automatically recognize many formats.

           For example,

                   objdump -b oasys -m vax -h fu.o

           displays summary information from the section headers (--hh) of _f_u_._o,
           which is explicitly identified (--mm) as a VAX object file in the
           format produced by Oasys compilers.  You can list the formats
           available with the --ii option.

       --CC
       ----ddeemmaannggllee[[==_s_t_y_l_e]]
           Decode (_d_e_m_a_n_g_l_e) low-level symbol names into user-level names.
           Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by the system,
           this makes C++ function names readable.  Different compilers have
           different mangling styles. The optional demangling style argument
           can be used to choose an appropriate demangling style for your
           compiler.

       ----rreeccuurrssee--lliimmiitt
       ----nnoo--rreeccuurrssee--lliimmiitt
       ----rreeccuurrssiioonn--lliimmiitt
       ----nnoo--rreeccuurrssiioonn--lliimmiitt
           Enables or disables a limit on the amount of recursion performed
           whilst demangling strings.  Since the name mangling formats allow
           for an inifinite level of recursion it is possible to create
           strings whose decoding will exhaust the amount of stack space
           available on the host machine, triggering a memory fault.  The
           limit tries to prevent this from happening by restricting recursion
           to 2048 levels of nesting.

           The default is for this limit to be enabled, but disabling it may
           be necessary in order to demangle truly complicated names.  Note
           however that if the recursion limit is disabled then stack
           exhaustion is possible and any bug reports about such an event will
           be rejected.

       --gg
       ----ddeebbuuggggiinngg
           Display debugging information.  This attempts to parse STABS
           debugging format information stored in the file and print it out
           using a C like syntax.  If no STABS debugging was found this option
           falls back on the --WW option to print any DWARF information in the
           file.

       --ee
       ----ddeebbuuggggiinngg--ttaaggss
           Like --gg, but the information is generated in a format compatible
           with ctags tool.

       --dd
       ----ddiissaasssseemmbbllee
       ----ddiissaasssseemmbbllee==_s_y_m_b_o_l
           Display the assembler mnemonics for the machine instructions from
           the input file.  This option only disassembles those sections which
           are expected to contain instructions.  If the optional _s_y_m_b_o_l
           argument is given, then display the assembler mnemonics starting at
           _s_y_m_b_o_l.  If _s_y_m_b_o_l is a function name then disassembly will stop at
           the end of the function, otherwise it will stop when the next
           symbol is encountered.  If there are no matches for _s_y_m_b_o_l then
           nothing will be displayed.

           Note if the ----ddwwaarrff==ffoollllooww--lliinnkkss option has also been enabled then
           any symbol tables in linked debug info files will be read in and
           used when disassembling.

       --DD
       ----ddiissaasssseemmbbllee--aallll
           Like --dd, but disassemble the contents of all sections, not just
           those expected to contain instructions.

           This option also has a subtle effect on the disassembly of
           instructions in code sections.  When option --dd is in effect objdump
           will assume that any symbols present in a code section occur on the
           boundary between instructions and it will refuse to disassemble
           across such a boundary.  When option --DD is in effect however this
           assumption is supressed.  This means that it is possible for the
           output of --dd and --DD to differ if, for example, data is stored in
           code sections.

           If the target is an ARM architecture this switch also has the
           effect of forcing the disassembler to decode pieces of data found
           in code sections as if they were instructions.

           Note if the ----ddwwaarrff==ffoollllooww--lliinnkkss option has also been enabled then
           any symbol tables in linked debug info files will be read in and
           used when disassembling.

       ----nnoo--aaddddrreesssseess
           When disassembling, don't print addresses on each line or for
           symbols and relocation offsets.  In combination with
           ----nnoo--sshhooww--rraaww--iinnssnn this may be useful for comparing compiler
           output.

       ----pprreeffiixx--aaddddrreesssseess
           When disassembling, print the complete address on each line.  This
           is the older disassembly format.

       --EEBB
       --EELL
       ----eennddiiaann=={{bbiigg||lliittttllee}}
           Specify the endianness of the object files.  This only affects
           disassembly.  This can be useful when disassembling a file format
           which does not describe endianness information, such as S-records.

       --ff
       ----ffiillee--hheeaaddeerrss
           Display summary information from the overall header of each of the
           _o_b_j_f_i_l_e files.

       --FF
       ----ffiillee--ooffffsseettss
           When disassembling sections, whenever a symbol is displayed, also
           display the file offset of the region of data that is about to be
           dumped.  If zeroes are being skipped, then when disassembly
           resumes, tell the user how many zeroes were skipped and the file
           offset of the location from where the disassembly resumes.  When
           dumping sections, display the file offset of the location from
           where the dump starts.

       ----ffiillee--ssttaarrtt--ccoonntteexxtt
           Specify that when displaying interlisted source code/disassembly
           (assumes --SS) from a file that has not yet been displayed, extend
           the context to the start of the file.

       --hh
       ----sseeccttiioonn--hheeaaddeerrss
       ----hheeaaddeerrss
           Display summary information from the section headers of the object
           file.

           File segments may be relocated to nonstandard addresses, for
           example by using the --TTtteexxtt, --TTddaattaa, or --TTbbssss options to lldd.
           However, some object file formats, such as a.out, do not store the
           starting address of the file segments.  In those situations,
           although lldd relocates the sections correctly, using oobbjjdduummpp --hh to
           list the file section headers cannot show the correct addresses.
           Instead, it shows the usual addresses, which are implicit for the
           target.

           Note, in some cases it is possible for a section to have both the
           READONLY and the NOREAD attributes set.  In such cases the NOREAD
           attribute takes precedence, but oobbjjdduummpp will report both since the
           exact setting of the flag bits might be important.

       --HH
       ----hheellpp
           Print a summary of the options to oobbjjdduummpp and exit.

       --ii
       ----iinnffoo
           Display a list showing all architectures and object formats
           available for specification with --bb or --mm.

       --jj _n_a_m_e
       ----sseeccttiioonn==_n_a_m_e
           Display information only for section _n_a_m_e.

       --ll
       ----lliinnee--nnuummbbeerrss
           Label the display (using debugging information) with the filename
           and source line numbers corresponding to the object code or relocs
           shown.  Only useful with --dd, --DD, or --rr.

       --mm _m_a_c_h_i_n_e
       ----aarrcchhiitteeccttuurree==_m_a_c_h_i_n_e
           Specify the architecture to use when disassembling object files.
           This can be useful when disassembling object files which do not
           describe architecture information, such as S-records.  You can list
           the available architectures with the --ii option.

           If the target is an ARM architecture then this switch has an
           additional effect.  It restricts the disassembly to only those
           instructions supported by the architecture specified by _m_a_c_h_i_n_e.
           If it is necessary to use this switch because the input file does
           not contain any architecture information, but it is also desired to
           disassemble all the instructions use --mmaarrmm.

       --MM _o_p_t_i_o_n_s
       ----ddiissaasssseemmbblleerr--ooppttiioonnss==_o_p_t_i_o_n_s
           Pass target specific information to the disassembler.  Only
           supported on some targets.  If it is necessary to specify more than
           one disassembler option then multiple --MM options can be used or can
           be placed together into a comma separated list.

           For ARC, ddsspp controls the printing of DSP instructions, ssppffpp
           selects the printing of FPX single precision FP instructions, ddppffpp
           selects the printing of FPX double precision FP instructions,
           qquuaarrkkssee__eemm selects the printing of special QuarkSE-EM instructions,
           ffppuuddaa selects the printing of double precision assist instructions,
           ffppuuss selects the printing of FPU single precision FP instructions,
           while ffppuudd selects the printing of FPU double precision FP
           instructions.  Additionally, one can choose to have all the
           immediates printed in hexadecimal using hheexx.  By default, the short
           immediates are printed using the decimal representation, while the
           long immediate values are printed as hexadecimal.

           ccppuu==...... allows to enforce a particular ISA when disassembling
           instructions, overriding the --mm value or whatever is in the ELF
           file.  This might be useful to select ARC EM or HS ISA, because
           architecture is same for those and disassembler relies on private
           ELF header data to decide if code is for EM or HS.  This option
           might be specified multiple times - only the latest value will be
           used.  Valid values are same as for the assembler --mmccppuu==...... option.

           If the target is an ARM architecture then this switch can be used
           to select which register name set is used during disassembler.
           Specifying --MM rreegg--nnaammeess--ssttdd (the default) will select the register
           names as used in ARM's instruction set documentation, but with
           register 13 called 'sp', register 14 called 'lr' and register 15
           called 'pc'.  Specifying --MM rreegg--nnaammeess--aappccss will select the name set
           used by the ARM Procedure Call Standard, whilst specifying --MM rreegg--
           nnaammeess--rraaww will just use rr followed by the register number.

           There are also two variants on the APCS register naming scheme
           enabled by --MM rreegg--nnaammeess--aattppccss and --MM rreegg--nnaammeess--ssppeecciiaall--aattppccss which
           use the ARM/Thumb Procedure Call Standard naming conventions.
           (Either with the normal register names or the special register
           names).

           This option can also be used for ARM architectures to force the
           disassembler to interpret all instructions as Thumb instructions by
           using the switch ----ddiissaasssseemmbblleerr--ooppttiioonnss==ffoorrccee--tthhuummbb.  This can be
           useful when attempting to disassemble thumb code produced by other
           compilers.

           For AArch64 targets this switch can be used to set whether
           instructions are disassembled as the most general instruction using
           the --MM nnoo--aalliiaasseess option or whether instruction notes should be
           generated as comments in the disasssembly using --MM nnootteess.

           For the x86, some of the options duplicate functions of the --mm
           switch, but allow finer grained control.

           "x86-64"
           "i386"
           "i8086"
               Select disassembly for the given architecture.

           "intel"
           "att"
               Select between intel syntax mode and AT&T syntax mode.

           "amd64"
           "intel64"
               Select between AMD64 ISA and Intel64 ISA.

           "intel-mnemonic"
           "att-mnemonic"
               Select between intel mnemonic mode and AT&T mnemonic mode.
               Note: "intel-mnemonic" implies "intel" and "att-mnemonic"
               implies "att".

           "addr64"
           "addr32"
           "addr16"
           "data32"
           "data16"
               Specify the default address size and operand size.  These five
               options will be overridden if "x86-64", "i386" or "i8086"
               appear later in the option string.

           "suffix"
               When in AT&T mode and also for a limited set of instructions
               when in Intel mode, instructs the disassembler to print a
               mnemonic suffix even when the suffix could be inferred by the
               operands or, for certain instructions, the execution mode's
               defaults.

           For PowerPC, the --MM argument rraaww selects disasssembly of hardware
           insns rather than aliases.  For example, you will see "rlwinm"
           rather than "clrlwi", and "addi" rather than "li".  All of the --mm
           arguments for ggaass that select a CPU are supported.  These are: 440033,
           440055, 444400, 446644, 447766, 660011, 660033, 660044, 662200, 77440000, 77441100, 77445500, 77445555,
           775500ccll, 882211, 885500, 886600, aa22, bbooookkee, bbooookkee3322, cceellll, ccoomm, ee220000zz44, ee330000,
           ee550000, ee550000mmcc, ee550000mmcc6644, ee550000xx22, ee55550000, ee66550000, eeffss, ppoowweerr44, ppoowweerr55,
           ppoowweerr66, ppoowweerr77, ppoowweerr88, ppoowweerr99, ppoowweerr1100, ppppcc, ppppcc3322, ppppcc6644,
           ppppcc6644bbrriiddggee, ppppccppss, ppwwrr, ppwwrr22, ppwwrr44, ppwwrr55, ppwwrr55xx, ppwwrr66, ppwwrr77, ppwwrr88,
           ppwwrr99, ppwwrr1100, ppwwrrxx, ttiittaann, and vvllee.  3322 and 6644 modify the default or
           a prior CPU selection, disabling and enabling 64-bit insns
           respectively.  In addition, aallttiivveecc, aannyy, hhttmm, vvssxx, and ssppee add
           capabilities to a previous _o_r _l_a_t_e_r CPU selection.  aannyy will
           disassemble any opcode known to binutils, but in cases where an
           opcode has two different meanings or different arguments, you may
           not see the disassembly you expect.  If you disassemble without
           giving a CPU selection, a default will be chosen from information
           gleaned by BFD from the object files headers, but the result again
           may not be as you expect.

           For MIPS, this option controls the printing of instruction mnemonic
           names and register names in disassembled instructions.  Multiple
           selections from the following may be specified as a comma separated
           string, and invalid options are ignored:

           "no-aliases"
               Print the 'raw' instruction mnemonic instead of some pseudo
               instruction mnemonic.  I.e., print 'daddu' or 'or' instead of
               'move', 'sll' instead of 'nop', etc.

           "msa"
               Disassemble MSA instructions.

           "virt"
               Disassemble the virtualization ASE instructions.

           "xpa"
               Disassemble the eXtended Physical Address (XPA) ASE
               instructions.

           "gpr-names=_A_B_I"
               Print GPR (general-purpose register) names as appropriate for
               the specified ABI.  By default, GPR names are selected
               according to the ABI of the binary being disassembled.

           "fpr-names=_A_B_I"
               Print FPR (floating-point register) names as appropriate for
               the specified ABI.  By default, FPR numbers are printed rather
               than names.

           "cp0-names=_A_R_C_H"
               Print CP0 (system control coprocessor; coprocessor 0) register
               names as appropriate for the CPU or architecture specified by
               _A_R_C_H.  By default, CP0 register names are selected according to
               the architecture and CPU of the binary being disassembled.

           "hwr-names=_A_R_C_H"
               Print HWR (hardware register, used by the "rdhwr" instruction)
               names as appropriate for the CPU or architecture specified by
               _A_R_C_H.  By default, HWR names are selected according to the
               architecture and CPU of the binary being disassembled.

           "reg-names=_A_B_I"
               Print GPR and FPR names as appropriate for the selected ABI.

           "reg-names=_A_R_C_H"
               Print CPU-specific register names (CP0 register and HWR names)
               as appropriate for the selected CPU or architecture.

           For any of the options listed above, _A_B_I or _A_R_C_H may be specified
           as nnuummeerriicc to have numbers printed rather than names, for the
           selected types of registers.  You can list the available values of
           _A_B_I and _A_R_C_H using the ----hheellpp option.

           For VAX, you can specify function entry addresses with --MM
           eennttrryy::00xxff0000bbaa.  You can use this multiple times to properly
           disassemble VAX binary files that don't contain symbol tables (like
           ROM dumps).  In these cases, the function entry mask would
           otherwise be decoded as VAX instructions, which would probably lead
           the rest of the function being wrongly disassembled.

       --pp
       ----pprriivvaattee--hheeaaddeerrss
           Print information that is specific to the object file format.  The
           exact information printed depends upon the object file format.  For
           some object file formats, no additional information is printed.

       --PP _o_p_t_i_o_n_s
       ----pprriivvaattee==_o_p_t_i_o_n_s
           Print information that is specific to the object file format.  The
           argument _o_p_t_i_o_n_s is a comma separated list that depends on the
           format (the lists of options is displayed with the help).

           For XCOFF, the available options are:

           "header"
           "aout"
           "sections"
           "syms"
           "relocs"
           "lineno,"
           "loader"
           "except"
           "typchk"
           "traceback"
           "toc"
           "ldinfo"

           Not all object formats support this option.  In particular the ELF
           format does not use it.

       --rr
       ----rreelloocc
           Print the relocation entries of the file.  If used with --dd or --DD,
           the relocations are printed interspersed with the disassembly.

       --RR
       ----ddyynnaammiicc--rreelloocc
           Print the dynamic relocation entries of the file.  This is only
           meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain types of shared
           libraries.  As for --rr, if used with --dd or --DD, the relocations are
           printed interspersed with the disassembly.

       --ss
       ----ffuullll--ccoonntteennttss
           Display the full contents of any sections requested.  By default
           all non-empty sections are displayed.

       --SS
       ----ssoouurrccee
           Display source code intermixed with disassembly, if possible.
           Implies --dd.

       ----ssoouurrccee--ccoommmmeenntt[[==_t_x_t]]
           Like the --SS option, but all source code lines are displayed with a
           prefix of _t_x_t.  Typically _t_x_t will be a comment string which can be
           used to distinguish the assembler code from the source code.  If
           _t_x_t is not provided then a default string of _"_# _" (hash followed by
           a space), will be used.

       ----pprreeffiixx==_p_r_e_f_i_x
           Specify _p_r_e_f_i_x to add to the absolute paths when used with --SS.

       ----pprreeffiixx--ssttrriipp==_l_e_v_e_l
           Indicate how many initial directory names to strip off the
           hardwired absolute paths. It has no effect without ----pprreeffiixx==_p_r_e_f_i_x.

       ----sshhooww--rraaww--iinnssnn
           When disassembling instructions, print the instruction in hex as
           well as in symbolic form.  This is the default except when
           ----pprreeffiixx--aaddddrreesssseess is used.

       ----nnoo--sshhooww--rraaww--iinnssnn
           When disassembling instructions, do not print the instruction
           bytes.  This is the default when ----pprreeffiixx--aaddddrreesssseess is used.

       ----iinnssnn--wwiiddtthh==_w_i_d_t_h
           Display _w_i_d_t_h bytes on a single line when disassembling
           instructions.

       ----vviissuuaalliizzee--jjuummppss[[==ccoolloorr||==eexxtteennddeedd--ccoolloorr||==ooffff]]
           Visualize jumps that stay inside a function by drawing ASCII art
           between the start and target addresses.  The optional ==ccoolloorr
           argument adds color to the output using simple terminal colors.
           Alternatively the ==eexxtteennddeedd--ccoolloorr argument will add color using
           8bit colors, but these might not work on all terminals.

           If it is necessary to disable the vviissuuaalliizzee--jjuummppss option after it
           has previously been enabled then use vviissuuaalliizzee--jjuummppss==ooffff.

           Displays the contents of the DWARF debug sections in the file, if
           any are present.  Compressed debug sections are automatically
           decompressed (temporarily) before they are displayed.  If one or
           more of the optional letters or words follows the switch then only
           those type(s) of data will be dumped.  The letters and words refer
           to the following information:

           "a"
           "=abbrev"
               Displays the contents of the ..ddeebbuugg__aabbbbrreevv section.

           "A"
           "=addr"
               Displays the contents of the ..ddeebbuugg__aaddddrr section.

           "c"
           "=cu_index"
               Displays the contents of the ..ddeebbuugg__ccuu__iinnddeexx and/or
               ..ddeebbuugg__ttuu__iinnddeexx sections.

           "f"
           "=frames"
               Display the raw contents of a ..ddeebbuugg__ffrraammee section.

           "F"
           "=frame-interp"
               Display the interpreted contents of a ..ddeebbuugg__ffrraammee section.

           "g"
           "=gdb_index"
               Displays the contents of the ..ggddbb__iinnddeexx and/or ..ddeebbuugg__nnaammeess
               sections.

           "i"
           "=info"
               Displays the contents of the ..ddeebbuugg__iinnffoo section.  Note: the
               output from this option can also be restricted by the use of
               the ----ddwwaarrff--ddeepptthh and ----ddwwaarrff--ssttaarrtt options.

           "k"
           "=links"
               Displays the contents of the ..ggnnuu__ddeebbuugglliinnkk and/or
               ..ggnnuu__ddeebbuuggaallttlliinnkk sections.  Also displays any links to
               separate dwarf object files (dwo), if they are specified by the
               DW_AT_GNU_dwo_name or DW_AT_dwo_name attributes in the
               ..ddeebbuugg__iinnffoo section.

           "K"
           "=follow-links"
               Display the contents of any selected debug sections that are
               found in linked, separate debug info file(s).  This can result
               in multiple versions of the same debug section being displayed
               if it exists in more than one file.

               In addition, when displaying DWARF attributes, if a form is
               found that references the separate debug info file, then the
               referenced contents will also be displayed.

           "l"
           "=rawline"
               Displays the contents of the ..ddeebbuugg__lliinnee section in a raw
               format.

           "L"
           "=decodedline"
               Displays the interpreted contents of the ..ddeebbuugg__lliinnee section.

           "m"
           "=macro"
               Displays the contents of the ..ddeebbuugg__mmaaccrroo and/or ..ddeebbuugg__mmaacciinnffoo
               sections.

           "o"
           "=loc"
               Displays the contents of the ..ddeebbuugg__lloocc and/or ..ddeebbuugg__lloocclliissttss
               sections.

           "O"
           "=str-offsets"
               Displays the contents of the ..ddeebbuugg__ssttrr__ooffffsseettss section.

           "p"
           "=pubnames"
               Displays the contents of the ..ddeebbuugg__ppuubbnnaammeess and/or
               ..ddeebbuugg__ggnnuu__ppuubbnnaammeess sections.

           "R"
           "=Ranges"
               Displays the contents of the ..ddeebbuugg__rraannggeess and/or
               ..ddeebbuugg__rrnngglliissttss sections.

           "s"
           "=str"

               ..ddeebbuugg__ssttrr__ooffffsseettss sections.

           "t"

               ..ddeebbuugg__ggnnuu__ppuubbttyyppeess sections.

           "T"

               Displays the contents of the ..ttrraaccee__aabbbbrreevv section.

           "U"
           "=trace_info"
               Displays the contents of the ..ttrraaccee__iinnffoo section.

           Note: displaying the contents of ..ddeebbuugg__ssttaattiicc__ffuunnccss,
           ..ddeebbuugg__ssttaattiicc__vvaarrss and ddeebbuugg__wweeaakknnaammeess sections is not currently
           supported.

       ----ddwwaarrff--ddeepptthh==_n
           Limit the dump of the ".debug_info" section to _n children.  This is
           only useful with ----ddeebbuugg--dduummpp==iinnffoo.  The default is to print all
           DIEs; the special value 0 for _n will also have this effect.

           With a non-zero value for _n, DIEs at or deeper than _n levels will
           not be printed.  The range for _n is zero-based.

       ----ddwwaarrff--ssttaarrtt==_n
           Print only DIEs beginning with the DIE numbered _n.  This is only
           useful with ----ddeebbuugg--dduummpp==iinnffoo.

           If specified, this option will suppress printing of any header
           information and all DIEs before the DIE numbered _n.  Only siblings
           and children of the specified DIE will be printed.

           This can be used in conjunction with ----ddwwaarrff--ddeepptthh.

       ----ddwwaarrff--cchheecckk
           Enable additional checks for consistency of Dwarf information.

       ----ccttff==_s_e_c_t_i_o_n
           Display the contents of the specified CTF section.  CTF sections
           themselves contain many subsections, all of which are displayed in
           order.

       ----ccttff--ppaarreenntt==_s_e_c_t_i_o_n
           Specify the name of another section from which the CTF dictionary
           can inherit types.  (If none is specified, we assume the CTF
           dictionary inherits types from the default-named member of the
           archive contained within this section.)

       --GG
       ----ssttaabbss
           Display the full contents of any sections requested.  Display the
           contents of the .stab and .stab.index and .stab.excl sections from
           an ELF file.  This is only useful on systems (such as Solaris 2.0)
           in which ".stab" debugging symbol-table entries are carried in an
           ELF section.  In most other file formats, debugging symbol-table
           entries are interleaved with linkage symbols, and are visible in
           the ----ssyymmss output.

       ----ssttaarrtt--aaddddrreessss==_a_d_d_r_e_s_s
           Start displaying data at the specified address.  This affects the
           output of the --dd, --rr and --ss options.

       ----ssttoopp--aaddddrreessss==_a_d_d_r_e_s_s
           Stop displaying data at the specified address.  This affects the
           output of the --dd, --rr and --ss options.

       --tt
       ----ssyymmss
           Print the symbol table entries of the file.  This is similar to the
           information provided by the nnmm program, although the display format
           is different.  The format of the output depends upon the format of
           the file being dumped, but there are two main types.  One looks
           like this:

                   [  4](sec  3)(fl 0x00)(ty   0)(scl   3) (nx 1) 0x00000000 .bss
                   [  6](sec  1)(fl 0x00)(ty   0)(scl   2) (nx 0) 0x00000000 fred

           where the number inside the square brackets is the number of the
           entry in the symbol table, the _s_e_c number is the section number,
           the _f_l value are the symbol's flag bits, the _t_y number is the
           symbol's type, the _s_c_l number is the symbol's storage class and the
           _n_x value is the number of auxilary entries associated with the
           symbol.  The last two fields are the symbol's value and its name.

           The other common output format, usually seen with ELF based files,
           looks like this:

                   00000000 l    d  .bss   00000000 .bss
                   00000000 g       .text  00000000 fred

           Here the first number is the symbol's value (sometimes refered to
           as its address).  The next field is actually a set of characters
           and spaces indicating the flag bits that are set on the symbol.
           These characters are described below.  Next is the section with
           which the symbol is associated or _*_A_B_S_* if the section is absolute
           (ie not connected with any section), or _*_U_N_D_* if the section is
           referenced in the file being dumped, but not defined there.

           After the section name comes another field, a number, which for
           common symbols is the alignment and for other symbol is the size.
           Finally the symbol's name is displayed.

           The flag characters are divided into 7 groups as follows:

           "l"
           "g"
           "u"
           "!" The symbol is a local (l), global (g), unique global (u),
               neither global nor local (a space) or both global and local
               (!).  A symbol can be neither local or global for a variety of
               reasons, e.g., because it is used for debugging, but it is
               probably an indication of a bug if it is ever both local and
               global.  Unique global symbols are a GNU extension to the
               standard set of ELF symbol bindings.  For such a symbol the
               dynamic linker will make sure that in the entire process there
               is just one symbol with this name and type in use.

           "w" The symbol is weak (w) or strong (a space).

           "C" The symbol denotes a constructor (C) or an ordinary symbol (a
               space).

           "W" The symbol is a warning (W) or a normal symbol (a space).  A
               warning symbol's name is a message to be displayed if the
               symbol following the warning symbol is ever referenced.

           "I"
           "i" The symbol is an indirect reference to another symbol (I), a
               function to be evaluated during reloc processing (i) or a
               normal symbol (a space).

           "d"
           "D" The symbol is a debugging symbol (d) or a dynamic symbol (D) or
               a normal symbol (a space).

           "F"
           "f"
           "O" The symbol is the name of a function (F) or a file (f) or an
               object (O) or just a normal symbol (a space).

       --TT
       ----ddyynnaammiicc--ssyymmss
           Print the dynamic symbol table entries of the file.  This is only
           meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain types of shared
           libraries.  This is similar to the information provided by the nnmm
           program when given the --DD (----ddyynnaammiicc) option.

           The output format is similar to that produced by the ----ssyymmss option,
           except that an extra field is inserted before the symbol's name,
           giving the version information associated with the symbol.  If the
           version is the default version to be used when resolving
           unversioned references to the symbol then it's displayed as is,
           otherwise it's put into parentheses.

       ----ssppeecciiaall--ssyymmss
           When displaying symbols include those which the target considers to
           be special in some way and which would not normally be of interest
           to the user.

       --VV
       ----vveerrssiioonn
           Print the version number of oobbjjdduummpp and exit.

       --xx
       ----aallll--hheeaaddeerrss
           Display all available header information, including the symbol
           table and relocation entries.  Using --xx is equivalent to specifying
           all of --aa --ff --hh --pp --rr --tt.

       --ww
       ----wwiiddee
           Format some lines for output devices that have more than 80
           columns.  Also do not truncate symbol names when they are
           displayed.

       --zz
       ----ddiissaasssseemmbbllee--zzeerrooeess
           Normally the disassembly output will skip blocks of zeroes.  This
           option directs the disassembler to disassemble those blocks, just
           like any other data.

       @@_f_i_l_e
           Read command-line options from _f_i_l_e.  The options read are inserted
           in place of the original @_f_i_l_e option.  If _f_i_l_e does not exist, or
           cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
           removed.

           Options in _f_i_l_e are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
           character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
           option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including
           a backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be
           included with a backslash.  The _f_i_l_e may itself contain additional
           @_f_i_l_e options; any such options will be processed recursively.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
       nnmm(1), rreeaaddeellff(1), and the Info entries for _b_i_n_u_t_i_l_s.
