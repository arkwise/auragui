       The  _z_l_i_b  library  is a general purpose data compression library.  The
       code is thread safe, assuming that the standard library functions  used
       are  thread  safe, such as memory allocation routines.  It provides in-
       memory compression and  decompression  functions,  including  integrity
       checks  of the uncompressed data.  This version of the library supports
       only one compression method (deflation) but  other  algorithms  may  be
       added later with the same stream interface.

       Compression  can  be  done  in  a  single step if the buffers are large
       enough or can be done by repeated calls of  the  compression  function.
       In the latter case, the application must provide more input and/or con-
       sume the output (providing more output space) before each call.

       The library also supports reading and writing files  in  _g_z_i_p(1)  (.gz)
       format with an interface similar to that of stdio.

       The  library  does  not install any signal handler.  The decoder checks
       the consistency of the compressed data, so  the  library  should  never
       crash even in the case of corrupted input.

       All  functions  of  the  compression library are documented in the file
       _z_l_i_b_._h.  The distribution  source  includes  examples  of  use  of  the
       library  in  the  files  _t_e_s_t_/_e_x_a_m_p_l_e_._c and _t_e_s_t_/_m_i_n_i_g_z_i_p_._c_, as well as
       other examples in the _e_x_a_m_p_l_e_s_/ directory.

       Changes to this version are  documented  in  the  file  _C_h_a_n_g_e_L_o_g  that
       accompanies the source.

       _z_l_i_b is built in to many languages and operating systems, including but
       not limited to Java, Python, .NET, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Swift, and Go.

       An experimental package to read and write files  in  the  .zip  format,
       written on top of _z_l_i_b by Gilles Vollant (info@winimage.com), is avail-
       able at:

              http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html  and  also  in  the
              _c_o_n_t_r_i_b_/_m_i_n_i_z_i_p directory of the main _z_l_i_b source distribution.

       The  data  format used by the _z_l_i_b library is described by RFC (Request
       for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files:

              http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950  (for  the  zlib  header  and
              trailer format)
              http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951  (for  the deflate compressed
              data format)
              http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1952  (for  the  gzip  header  and
              trailer format)
