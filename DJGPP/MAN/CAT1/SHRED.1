       shred  -  delete  a file securely, first overwriting it to
       hide its contents

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Overwrite the specified FILE(s) repeatedly,  in  order  to
       make it harder for even very expensive hardware probing to
       recover the data.

       --ff, ----ffoorrccee
              change permissions to allow writing if necessary

       --nn, ----iitteerraattiioonnss=_N
              Overwrite N times instead of the default (25)

       --ss, ----ssiizzee=_N
              shred this  many  bytes  (suffixes  like  k,  M,  G
              accepted)

       --uu, ----rreemmoovvee
              truncate and remove file after overwriting

       --vv, ----vveerrbboossee
              show progress

       --xx, ----eexxaacctt
              do not round file sizes up to the next full block

       --zz, ----zzeerroo
              add a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding

       -      shred standard output

       ----hheellpp display this help and exit

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              print version information and exit

       Delete FILE(s) if ----rreemmoovvee (-u) is specified.  The default
       is not to remove the files because it is common to operate
       on  device  files  like  /dev/hda, and those files usually
       should not be removed.  When operating on  regular  files,
       most people use the ----rreemmoovvee option.

       CAUTION:  Note  that  shred  relies  on  a  very important
       assumption: that the filesystem overwrites data in  place.
       This  is the traditional way to do things, but many modern
       filesystem designs do not satisfy  this  assumption.   The
       following  are  examples  of filesystems on which shred is
       not effective:

       * log-structured or journaled filesystems, such  as  those
       supplied with

              AIX and Solaris (and JFS, ReiserFS, XFS, etc.)

       *  filesystems that write redundant data and carry on even
       if some writes

              fail, such as RAID-based filesystems

       * filesystems that make snapshots, such as Network  Appli-
       ance's NFS server

       *  filesystems  that cache in temporary locations, such as
       NFS

              version 3 clients

       * compressed filesystems
