       GNU nnmm lists the symbols from object files _o_b_j_f_i_l_e....  If
       no  object  files  are listed as arguments, nnmm assumes the
       file _a_._o_u_t.

       For each symbol, nnmm shows:

       +o   The symbol value, in the  radix  selected  by  options
           (see below), or hexadecimal by default.

       +o   The  symbol  type.   At  least the following types are
           used; others are, as well,  depending  on  the  object
           file  format.   If  lowercase, the symbol is local; if
           uppercase, the symbol is global (external).

           "A" The symbol's value is absolute, and  will  not  be
               changed by further linking.

           "B" The  symbol  is  in the uninitialized data section
               (known as BSS).

           "C" The  symbol  is  common.    Common   symbols   are
               uninitialized data.  When linking, multiple common
               symbols may appear with the  same  name.   If  the
               symbol is defined anywhere, the common symbols are
               treated as undefined references.

           "D" The symbol is in the initialized data section.

           "G" The symbol is in an initialized data  section  for
               small  objects.   Some  object file formats permit
               more efficient access to small data objects,  such
               as  a  global  int  variable as opposed to a large
               global array.

           "I" The symbol is an  indirect  reference  to  another
               symbol.   This  is  a  GNU  extension to the a.out
               object file format which is rarely used.

NM(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 NM(1)


           "N" The symbol is a debugging symbol.

           "R" The symbol is in a read only data section.

           "S" The symbol is in an uninitialized data section for
               small objects.

           "T" The symbol is in the text (code) section.

           "U" The symbol is undefined.

           "V" The  symbol is a weak object.  When a weak defined
               symbol is linked with a normal defined symbol, the
               normal defined symbol is used with no error.  When
               a weak undefined symbol is linked and  the  symbol
               is  not  defined,  the  value  of  the weak symbol
               becomes zero with no error.

           "W" The symbol is a weak  symbol  that  has  not  been
               specifically tagged as a weak object symbol.  When
               a weak defined symbol  is  linked  with  a  normal
               defined  symbol, the normal defined symbol is used
               with no error.  When a weak  undefined  symbol  is
               linked and the symbol is not defined, the value of
               the symbol  is  determined  in  a  system-specific
               manner  without error.  On some systems, uppercase
               indicates that a default value has been specified.

           "-" The  symbol  is  a stabs symbol in an a.out object
               file.  In this case, the next values  printed  are
               the  stabs  other field, the stabs desc field, and
               the stab type.  Stabs symbols  are  used  to  hold
               debugging information.

           "?" The  symbol type is unknown, or object file format
               specific.

       +o   The symbol name.

       --oo
       ----pprriinntt--ffiillee--nnaammee

           archive member) in which it  was  found,  rather  than
           identifying  the  input  file once only, before all of
           its symbols.

           normally these are not listed.

       --BB  The  same  as ----ffoorrmmaatt==bbssdd (for compatibility with the
           MIPS nnmm).

       --CC
       ----ddeemmaannggllee[[==_s_t_y_l_e]]
           Decode (_d_e_m_a_n_g_l_e) low-level symbol  names  into  user-
           level  names.  Besides removing any initial underscore
           prepended by the system, this makes C++ function names
           readable.  Different compilers have different mangling
           styles. The optional demangling style argument can  be
           used  to  choose  an  appropriate demangling style for
           your compiler.

       ----nnoo--ddeemmaannggllee
           Do not demangle low-level symbol names.  This  is  the
           default.

       --DD
       ----ddyynnaammiicc
           Display  the  dynamic  symbols  rather than the normal
           symbols.  This is only meaningful for dynamic objects,
           such as certain types of shared libraries.

       --ff _f_o_r_m_a_t
       ----ffoorrmmaatt==_f_o_r_m_a_t
           Use  the  output  format  _f_o_r_m_a_t,  which can be "bsd",
           "sysv", or "posix".  The default is "bsd".   Only  the
           first  character  of  _f_o_r_m_a_t is significant; it can be
           either upper or lower case.

       --gg
       ----eexxtteerrnn--oonnllyy
           Display only external symbols.

       --ll
       ----lliinnee--nnuummbbeerrss
           For each symbol, use debugging information to  try  to
           find  a  filename  and  line  number.   For  a defined
           symbol, look for the line number of the address of the
           symbol.   For  an  undefined symbol, look for the line
           number of a  relocation  entry  which  refers  to  the
           symbol.   If  line  number  information  can be found,
           print it after the other symbol information.

       --nn
       --vv
       ----nnuummeerriicc--ssoorrtt
           Sort symbols numerically by  their  addresses,  rather
           than alphabetically by their names.

       --pp

NM(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 NM(1)


       ----nnoo--ssoorrtt
           Do  not bother to sort the symbols in any order; print
           them in the order encountered.

       --PP
       ----ppoorrttaabbiilliittyy
           Use the POSIX.2 standard output format instead of  the
           default format.  Equivalent to --ff ppoossiixx.

       --SS
       ----pprriinntt--ssiizzee
           Print  size, not the value, of defined symbols for the
           "bsd" output format.

       --ss
       ----pprriinntt--aarrmmaapp
           When listing symbols from archive members, include the
           index:  a  mapping  (stored  in  the  archive by aarr or
           rraannlliibb) of which modules contain definitions for which
           names.

       --rr
       ----rreevveerrssee--ssoorrtt
           Reverse  the  order  of  the  sort (whether numeric or
           alphabetic); let the last come first.

       ----ssiizzee--ssoorrtt
           Sort symbols by size.  The size  is  computed  as  the
           difference  between  the  value  of the symbol and the
           value of the symbol with the next  higher  value.   If
           the "bsd" output format is used the size of the symbol
           is printed, rather than the value, and --SS must be used
           in order both size and value to be printed.

       ----ssppeecciiaall--ssyymmss
           Display  symbols  which have a target-specific special
           meaning.  These symbols are usually used by the target
           for  some  special  processing  and  are  not normally
           helpful when included included in  the  normal  symbol
           lists.   For example for ARM targets this option would
           skip the mapping symbols  used  to  mark  transistions
           between ARM code, THUMB code and data.

       --tt _r_a_d_i_x
       ----rraaddiixx==_r_a_d_i_x
           Use _r_a_d_i_x as the radix for printing the symbol values.
           It must be dd for  decimal,  oo  for  octal,  or  xx  for
           hexadecimal.

       ----ttaarrggeett==_b_f_d_n_a_m_e
           Specify an object code format other than your system's
           default format.

       ----uunnddeeffiinneedd--oonnllyy
           Display only undefined symbols (those external to each
           object file).

       ----ddeeffiinneedd--oonnllyy
           Display only defined symbols for each object file.

           Show the version number of nnmm and exit.

       --XX  This  option is ignored for compatibility with the AIX
           version of nnmm.  It takes one parameter which  must  be
           the   string  3322__6644.   The  default  mode  of  AIX  nnmm
           corresponds to --XX 3322, which is not  supported  by  GNU
           nnmm.

       ----hheellpp
           Show a summary of the options to nnmm and exit.

       @@_f_i_l_e
           Read command-line options from _f_i_l_e.  The options read
           are inserted in place of the  original  @_f_i_l_e  option.
           If  _f_i_l_e  does  not exist, or cannot be read, then the
           option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options  in  _f_i_l_e  are  separated  by  whitespace.   A
           whitespace  character  may be included in an option by
           surrounding the entire  option  in  either  single  or
           double  quotes.  Any character (including a backslash)
           may be included  by  prefixing  the  character  to  be
           included  with  a  backslash.   The  _f_i_l_e  may  itself
           contain additional @_f_i_l_e  options;  any  such  options
           will be processed recursively.
