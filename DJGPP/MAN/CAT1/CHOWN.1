       This  manual  page  documents  the  GNU  version of cchhoowwnn.
       cchhoowwnn changes the user  and/or  group  ownership  of  each
       given  file,  according  to its first non-option argument,
       which is interpreted as follows.  If only a user name  (or
       numeric  user ID) is given, that user is made the owner of
       each given file, and the files' group is not changed.   If
       the  user  name  is followed by a colon or dot and a group
       name (or numeric group ID), with no spaces  between  them,
       the group ownership of the files is changed as well.  If a
       colon or dot but no group name follows the user name, that
       user  is  made the owner of the files and the group of the
       files is changed to that user's login group.  If the colon
       or  dot and group are given, but the user name is omitted,
       only the group of the files  is  changed;  in  this  case,
       cchhoowwnn performs the same function as cchhggrrpp.

       Change the owner and/or group of each FILE to OWNER and/or
       GROUP.

       --cc, ----cchhaannggeess
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       ----ddeerreeffeerreennccee
              affect the referent of each symbolic  link,  rather
              than the symbolic link itself

       --hh, ----nnoo--ddeerreeffeerreennccee
              affect  symbolic  links  instead  of any referenced
              file (available only on systems that can change the
              ownership of a symlink)

       ----ffrroomm=_C_U_R_R_E_N_T___O_W_N_E_R:CURRENT_GROUP
              change  the owner and/or group of each file only if
              its current owner and/or group match  those  speci-
              fied  here.  Either may be omitted, in which case a
              match is not required for the omitted attribute.

       --ff, ----ssiilleenntt, ----qquuiieett
              suppress most error messages

       ----rreeffeerreennccee=_R_F_I_L_E
              use RFILE's owner and group rather than the  speci-
              fied OWNER:GROUP values

       Owner  is  unchanged  if  missing.   Group is unchanged if
       missing, but changed to login group if implied by  a  `:'.
       OWNER and GROUP may be numeric as well as symbolic.
