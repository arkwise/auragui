       rraannlliibb  generates  an  index to the contents of an archive
       and stores it in the archive.  The index lists each symbol
       defined  by  a  member of an archive that is a relocatable
       object file.

       You may use nnmm --ss or nnmm ----pprriinntt--aarrmmaapp to list this  index.

       An  archive  with  such  an index speeds up linking to the
       library and allows routines in the library  to  call  each
       other without regard to their placement in the archive.

       The  GNU rraannlliibb program is another form of GNU aarr; running
       rraannlliibb is completely equivalent to executing aarr --ss.

       @@_f_i_l_e
           Read command-line options from _f_i_l_e.  The options read
           are  inserted  in  place of the original @_f_i_l_e option.
           If _f_i_l_e does not exist, or cannot be  read,  then  the
           option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options  in  _f_i_l_e  are  separated  by  whitespace.   A
           whitespace character may be included in an  option  by
           surrounding  the  entire  option  in  either single or
           double quotes.  Any character (including a  backslash)
           may  be  included  by  prefixing  the  character to be
           included  with  a  backslash.   The  _f_i_l_e  may  itself
           contain  additional  @_f_i_l_e  options;  any such options
           will be processed recursively.
