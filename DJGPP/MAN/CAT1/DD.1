       Copy  a  file,  converting and formatting according to the
       options.

       bs=BYTES
              force ibs=BYTES and obs=BYTES

       cbs=BYTES
              convert BYTES bytes at a time

       conv=KEYWORDS
              convert the file as per the comma separated keyword
              list

       count=BLOCKS
              copy only BLOCKS input blocks

       ibs=BYTES
              read BYTES bytes at a time

       if=FILE
              read from FILE instead of stdin

       obs=BYTES
              write BYTES bytes at a time

       of=FILE
              write to FILE instead of stdout

       seek=BLOCKS
              skip BLOCKS obs-sized blocks at start of output

       skip=BLOCKS
              skip BLOCKS ibs-sized blocks at start of input

       ----hheellpp display this help and exit

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              output version information and exit

       BLOCKS  and  BYTES may be followed by the following multi-
       plicative suffixes: xM M, c 1, w 2,  b  512,  kD  1000,  k
       1024,  MD  1,000,000,  M  1,048,576,  GD  1,000,000,000, G
       1,073,741,824, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.  Each  KEYWORD

       ibm    from ASCII to alternated EBCDIC

       block  pad  newline-terminated records with spaces to cbs-
              size

       unblock
              replace trailing spaces in  cbs-size  records  with
              newline

       lcase  change upper case to lower case

       notrunc
              do not truncate the output file

       ucase  change lower case to upper case

       swab   swap every pair of input bytes

       noerror
              continue after read errors

       sync   pad  every  input block with NULs to ibs-size; when
              used

              with block or unblock, pad with spaces rather  than
              NULs
