       aaddddrr22lliinnee translates addresses into file  names  and  line
       numbers.   Given  an address in an executable or an offset
       in  a  section  of  a  relocatable  object,  it  uses  the
       debugging  information  to  figure out which file name and
       line number are associated with it.

       The executable or relocatable object to use  is  specified
       with  the  --ee option.  The default is the file _a_._o_u_t.  The
       section in the relocatable object to use is specified with
       the --jj option.

       aaddddrr22lliinnee has two modes of operation.

       In  the  first, hexadecimal addresses are specified on the
       command line, and aaddddrr22lliinnee displays  the  file  name  and
       line number for each address.

       In  the second, aaddddrr22lliinnee reads hexadecimal addresses from
       standard input, and prints the file name and  line  number
       for  each  address  on  standard  output.   In  this mode,
       aaddddrr22lliinnee may be used in a  pipe  to  convert  dynamically
       chosen addresses.

       The  format  of  the  output is FFIILLEENNAAMMEE::LLIINNEENNOO.  The file
       name and line number for each  address  is  printed  on  a
       separate  line.   If  the  --ff  option  is  used, then each
       FFIILLEENNAAMMEE::LLIINNEENNOO line is preceded by  a  FFUUNNCCTTIIOONNNNAAMMEE  line
       which  is the name of the function containing the address.

       If the file name or function name can not  be  determined,
       aaddddrr22lliinnee  will  print  two question marks in their place.
       If the line number can not be determined,  aaddddrr22lliinnee  will
       print 0.

       alternatives, are equivalent.

       --bb _b_f_d_n_a_m_e
       ----ttaarrggeett==_b_f_d_n_a_m_e
           Specify that the object-code  format  for  the  object
           files is _b_f_d_n_a_m_e.

       --CC
       ----ddeemmaannggllee[[==_s_t_y_l_e]]
           Decode  (_d_e_m_a_n_g_l_e)  low-level  symbol names into user-
           level names.  Besides removing any initial  underscore
           prepended by the system, this makes C++ function names
           readable.  Different compilers have different mangling
           styles.  The optional demangling style argument can be
           used to choose an  appropriate  demangling  style  for
           your compiler.

       --ee _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
       ----eexxee==_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
           Specify the name of the executable for which addresses
           should be translated.  The default file is _a_._o_u_t.

       --ff
       ----ffuunnccttiioonnss
           Display function names as well as file and line number
           information.

       --ss
       ----bbaasseennaammeess
           Display only the base of each file name.

       --ii
       ----iinnlliinneess
           If the address belongs to a function that was inlined,
           the source information for all enclosing  scopes  back
           to   the  first  non-inlined  function  will  also  be
           printed.  For example,  if  "main"  inlines  "callee1"
           which   inlines   "callee2",   and   address  is  from
           "callee2", the source information  for  "callee1"  and
           "main" will also be printed.

       --jj
       ----sseeccttiioonn
           Read offsets relative to the specified section instead
           of absolute addresses.

       @@_f_i_l_e
           Read command-line options from _f_i_l_e.  The options read
           are  inserted  in  place of the original @_f_i_l_e option.
           If _f_i_l_e does not exist, or cannot be  read,  then  the
           option will be treated literally, and not removed.

           Options  in  _f_i_l_e  are  separated  by  whitespace.   A
           whitespace character may be included in an  option  by
           surrounding  the  entire  option  in  either single or
           double quotes.  Any character (including a  backslash)

           may  be  included  by  prefixing  the  character to be
           included  with  a  backslash.   The  _f_i_l_e  may  itself
           contain  additional  @_f_i_l_e  options;  any such options
           will be processed recursively.
