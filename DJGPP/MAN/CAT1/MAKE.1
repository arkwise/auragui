       This  man  page  is an extract of the documentation of _G_N_U
       _m_a_k_e _.  It is updated only occasionally, because  the  GNU
       project  does  not use nroff.  For complete, current docu-
       mentation, refer to the Info file mmaakkee..iinnffoo which is  made
       from the Texinfo source file mmaakkee..tteexxiinnffoo.

       The  purpose of the _m_a_k_e utility is to determine automati-
       cally which pieces of a large program need  to  be  recom-
       piled, and issue the commands to recompile them.  The man-
       ual describes the GNU implementation of  _m_a_k_e,  which  was
       written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath.  Our exam-
       ples show C programs, since they are most common, but  you
       can  use _m_a_k_e with any programming language whose compiler
       can be run with a shell command.  In  fact,  _m_a_k_e  is  not
       limited  to programs.  You can use it to describe any task
       where some files must be updated automatically from others
       whenever the others change.

       To  prepare  to use _m_a_k_e, you must write a file called the
       _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e that describes the relationships among  files  in
       your  program,  and  the  states the commands for updating
       each file.  In a program, typically the executable file is
       updated  from object files, which are in turn made by com-
       piling source files.

       Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some
       source files, this simple shell command:

              mmaakkee

       suffices  to  perform  all  necessary recompilations.  The
       _m_a_k_e program uses the makefile data base and the last-mod-
       ification  times of the files to decide which of the files
       need to be updated.  For each of those  files,  it  issues
       the commands recorded in the data base.

       _m_a_k_e  executes  commands  in the _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e to update one or
       more target _n_a_m_e_s, where _n_a_m_e is typically a program.   If
       no  --ff option is present, _m_a_k_e will look for the makefiles
       _G_N_U_m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e, _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e, and _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e, in that order.

       Normally you should call your makefile either _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e  or
       _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e.   (We  recommend  _M_a_k_e_f_i_l_e  because  it  appears
       prominently near the beginning  of  a  directory  listing,
       right  near  other  important  files such as _R_E_A_D_M_E.)  The
       first name checked, _G_N_U_m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e, is  not  recommended  for

       most  makefiles.   You  should use this name if you have a
       makefile that is specific to GNU _m_a_k_e,  and  will  not  be
       understood by other versions of _m_a_k_e.  If _m_a_k_e_f_i_l_e is `-',
       the standard input is read.

       _m_a_k_e updates a target if it depends on prerequisite  files
       that  have  been  modified since the target was last modi-
       fied, or if the target does not exist.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --bb

       --mm   These options  are  ignored  for  compatibility  with
            other versions of _m_a_k_e.

       --CC _d_i_r
            Change  to directory _d_i_r before reading the makefiles
            or doing anything else.  If multiple --CC  options  are
            specified, each is interpreted relative to the previ-
            ous one: --CC / --CC etc is equivalent to --CC /etc.   This
            is typically used with recursive invocations of _m_a_k_e.

       --dd   Print debugging information  in  addition  to  normal
            processing.   The  debugging  information  says which
            files are being considered for remaking, which  file-
            times are being compared and with what results, which
            files actually need  to  be  remade,  which  implicit
            rules  are  considered and which are applied---every-
            thing interesting about how _m_a_k_e decides what to  do.

       --ee   Give  variables taken from the environment precedence
            over variables from makefiles.

       --ff _f_i_l_e
            Use _f_i_l_e as a makefile.

       --ii   Ignore all errors  in  commands  executed  to  remake
            files.

       --II _d_i_r
            Specifies  a  directory  _d_i_r  to  search for included
            makefiles.  If several --II options are used to specify
            several  directories, the directories are searched in
            the order specified.  Unlike the arguments  to  other
            flags  of  _m_a_k_e,  directories given with --II flags may
            come directly after the flag: --II_d_i_r  is  allowed,  as
            well  as --II _d_i_r_.  This syntax is allowed for compati-
            bility with the C preprocessor's --II flag.

       --jj _j_o_b_s
            Specifies the number of jobs (commands) to run simul-
            taneously.   If there is more than one --jj option, the
            last one is effective.  If the  --jj  option  is  given
            without  an  argument, _m_a_k_e will not limit the number

MAKE(1L)               LOCAL USER COMMANDS               MAKE(1L)


            of jobs that can run simultaneously.

       --kk   Continue as much as possible after an  error.   While
            the  target that failed, and those that depend on it,
            cannot be remade, the  other  dependencies  of  these
            targets can be processed all the same.

       --ll

       --ll _l_o_a_d
            Specifies  that  no  new  jobs  (commands)  should be
            started if there are others jobs running and the load
            average  is  at least _l_o_a_d (a floating-point number).
            With no argument, removes a previous load limit.

       --nn   Print the commands that would be executed, but do not
            execute them.

       --oo _f_i_l_e
            Do  not remake the file _f_i_l_e even if it is older than
            its dependencies,  and  do  not  remake  anything  on
            account  of changes in _f_i_l_e.  Essentially the file is
            treated as very old and its rules are ignored.

       --pp   Print the data base (rules and variable values)  that
            results  from  reading the makefiles; then execute as
            usual or as otherwise specified.   This  also  prints
            the  version  information given by the --vv switch (see
            below).  To print the data  base  without  trying  to
            remake any files, use mmaakkee --pp --ff_/_d_e_v_/_n_u_l_l_.

       --qq   ``Question mode''.  Do not run any commands, or print
            anything; just return an exit status that is zero  if
            the specified targets are already up to date, nonzero
            otherwise.

       --rr   Eliminate use of the built-in implicit  rules.   Also
            clear  out  the  default  list of suffixes for suffix
            rules.

       --ss   Silent operation; do not print the commands  as  they
            are executed.

       --SS   Cancel  the  effect  of the --kk option.  This is never
            necessary except in a recursive _m_a_k_e where  --kk  might
            be inherited from the top-level _m_a_k_e via MAKEFLAGS or
            if you set --kk in MAKEFLAGS in your environment.

       --tt   Touch files (mark them  up  to  date  without  really
            changing  them)  instead  of  running their commands.
            This is used to pretend that the commands were  done,
            in order to fool future invocations of _m_a_k_e.

       --vv   Print   the  version  of  the  _m_a_k_e  program  plus  a

            copyright, a list of authors and a notice that  there
            is no warranty.

       --ww   Print  a  message  containing  the  working directory
            before and after other processing.  This may be  use-
            ful  for  tracking down errors from complicated nests
            of recursive _m_a_k_e commands.

       --WW _f_i_l_e
            Pretend that the target _f_i_l_e has just been  modified.
            When used with the --nn flag, this shows you what would
            happen if you were to modify that file.  Without  --nn,
            it  is  almost the same as running a _t_o_u_c_h command on
            the given file before running _m_a_k_e, except  that  the
            modification  time is changed only in the imagination
            of _m_a_k_e.
